# Commandline Challenge
## CMD CHALLENGE is an online game on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line on the website and the questions become increasingly more complicated. Itâ€™s good training to improve command line skills. Each file shows the challenges I've completed.

## Steps to Use SFTP

1. **Establish an SFTP Session:** Open a terminal or command prompt and issue the following command, replacing `username` with your actual username and `serverip` with the server's IP address or hostname.
    ```
    sftp username@serverip
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory on the remote server where you want to upload your files.
    ```
    cd path
    ```

3. **Upload Files:** To upload files from your local system to the remote server, use the `put` command followed by the filename. Replace `filename` with the actual name of the file you want to upload.
    ```
    put filename
    ```

4. **Exit SFTP Session:** When you're done uploading files and want to exit the SFTP session, use the following command:
    ```
    exit
    ```

These steps will allow you to securely transfer files to the remote server using SFTP.
